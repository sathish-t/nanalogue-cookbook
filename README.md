# Introduction

Nanalogue = *N*ucleic Acid *Analogue* 

A common pain point in the genomics community is that BAM files are information-dense
which makes it difficult to gain insight from them. Nanalogue hopes to make it easy
to extract and process this information. This repository illustrates nanalogue's
commands. The site generated from this repository can be seen [here](https://www.nanalogue.com).
These materials are under development.

For contributors, see [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md) for documentation on the automated testing and generation systems.
